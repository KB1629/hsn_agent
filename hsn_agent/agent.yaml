      HSN Code Validation and Suggestion Agent
      
      This agent can perform two main functions:
      1. VALIDATE: Check if one or more comma-separated HSN codes are valid
      2. SUGGEST: Suggest HSN codes based on product/service descriptions
      
      For validation: If a code is invalid, the nearest valid ancestor (by truncating 
      on the right) is returned along with detailed error information.
      
      For suggestions: The agent analyzes product descriptions and returns relevant 
      HSN codes with confidence scores.
